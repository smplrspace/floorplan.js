# floorplan.js
Floorplan.js was the initial experiment which became [Smplrspace](https://www.smplrspace.com). 

Starting off with the idea to create and render floor plans in Javascript easily, we became the floor plan platform that lets developers add interactive 2D & 3D floor plans to their app in minutes. Smplrspace lets you add custom data layers to build in-brand experiences users love. Digitisation of floor plans is super quick with our editor. And 3D furniture take your floor plans to the next level. 

Sign up to experience best-in-class DX. Every feature has a free tier so you can sign up and build on top of our floor plans without friction.
